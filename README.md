# Awareness (PP1)

Awareness is my first website created on my own, it is a project to design a responsive site for mental health awareness using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.  In the project, I try to adept a structural design process, make often and practical commits, and keep to best coding practice. Secondly, the project is also a first attemp to implicate use of AI to assist the design and coding process.

## Design

To ensure a mindful product with complete features, my design process follows a logical workflow.

### User Stories

First off all, I identified users by using copilot to generate some user examples and then filtered and added my own ideas.  Following the same logic I then propmted copilot to generate user stories and then filtered and added my own on top.

<img src="assets/images/readme/users.jpg" alt="copilot users" width=50%>
<img src="assets/images/readme/stories.jpg" alt="copilot users" width=50%>

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;"></p>

Then I then created issues after identifying the acceptance criteria and tasks associate with the user stories.  With this I identified what features I would like in the website.  Finally, I then decided their importance in the website and set their priority in the project (please see the linked project Awareness User Story).

### Layout and Color Scheme/Fonts

I then used balsamic to create layouts of the three pages I planned on having.  I created 3 differnt layouts for each page targeting mobile, tablet and desktop devices.  In these layouts, I considered what I would believe to look best and is most natural to view on each screen size and designed my responsive grid/features accordingly.

<img src="assets/images/readme/layout1.jpg" alt="copilot users" width=50%>
<img src="assets/images/readme/layout2.jpg" alt="copilot users" width=50%>
<img src="assets/images/readme/layout3.jpg" alt="copilot users" width=50%>

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;"></p>

I picked my color scheme and fonts with consideration of users in mind.  I wanted the site to be warm and welcoming to individuals who need help, but keep a professional and clear look to appear trustworthy.  In the end, I settled on a color scheme of yellow blue and green in refernce of advice found on [this article](https://bungalowwebdesign.com/7-best-color-palettes-for-therapy-websites-in-2023-examples/).  I choose yellow as the warm basetone to the website and blue as a contrast color as text color, green is used as a feature color as green ribbon is a representation for mental health awareness.  You can find the full set of color scheme in my css file as css variables.

I picked Poppin for all headings and features to give a professional look to the website and PT serif for inner text for a softer, easier to look at style.

## Features 

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

### Existing Features

  - Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, Gallery and Sign Up page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
  - This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Credits 

In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 

You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project. 

### Content 

- The text for the Home page was taken from Wikipedia Article A
- Instructions on how to implement form validation on the Sign Up page was taken from [Specific YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/)
- The icons in the footer were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

### Media

- The photos used on the home and sign up page are from This Open Source site

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
  - [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
